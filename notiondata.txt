People Ops - General


Below is a guideline of Codelitt‚Äôs general policies and practices, subject to change as we continue to grow. We ask that all team members respect and follow these guidelines, and share any concerns or feedback they have!



Mission Statement
At Codelitt, we value all our employees and want them to be happy, excited and ready to take on projects together as a collaborative team. We prioritize meritocracy above all and focus on your skills, experience and ability to contribute to Codelitt and our clients. Your title and seniority should not limit your ability to contribute and grow with the company.

Our team is 100% remote, which means we look for the best in each field to join our ranks from all around the world. We believe in rewarding hard work no matter the person‚Äôs background, and strive to give everyone a fair opportunity to meet their full potential.

Additionally, we expect all employees to respect one another, and learn to celebrate and thrive on our cultural differences and strengths (customs, personalities, communication and work styles, etc.) instead of being blocked by them. All our team members should aspire to be forward-thinking, collaborative, patient, and above all, kind human beings.

Represented Countries
Codelitt is proud to have a passionate and talented group of team members currently represented by the following countries:

US
UK
Brazil
Argentina
Mexico
Canada
Spain
Turkey
Serbia
Equal Opportunity / Non-Discrimination Policy
Codelitt is a collaborative team that does not support or tolerate discrimination and/or harassment of any kind, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability.

If you feel that you are experiencing any form of harassment, we encourage you to inform your manager immediately or People Ops immediately.

Please feel free to report to your manager or People Ops any behavior you feel uncomfortable, and we will look into the matter discreetly and confidentially.



Attendance Policy
If you anticipate being absent from work for any reason, please notify your manager as soon as possible. If you continuously fail to account for your work hours or you are unavailable without excuse, you may be subject to disciplinary action (see ‚ÄúCodelitt‚Äôs Disciplinary Policy‚Äù below).
If you will be gone longer than 1 hour, please inform your manager, update Rippling (our time-off platform) with the times you are unavailable, and inform team members in your respective Slack channels.


Work Hours & Meetings
We are a remote team that favors progress and results over set hours.  These freedoms do come with conditions, as stated below.

Mandatory Meetings and Calls
All internal calls must be attended by video conference (Zoom or Google Hangouts), unless there are any issues with an internet connection, streaming, or personal circumstances that make it difficult to be available through video.
Note: This exception should only apply under specific circumstances, as stated above. Please check with People Ops (PeopleOps@Codelitt.com) and your manager to make sure this applies to your situation before turning off your video settings.
You must make yourself available for the 9:30 a.m. EST standup meeting that is held every Friday.
You must make yourself available for any normal workday calls which may regard your position in the team.
You must make yourself available to meet with your manager for periodic one on one meetings. The frequency of these meetings will be decided by you and your manager.
If you will be absent or away from your computer for longer than 1 hour, please let your manager or relevant team members know directly.
Note: Frequent absences or long break periods for more than 1 hour without recording this time on Rippling (you must record under ‚ÄúErrands‚Äù) will be subject to manager review and discipline.



Client Calls & Meetings
Client Calls and Messages
If you are a member of a team and working with a client that has traditional business hours (e.g. 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. EST/CST), you must make yourself available throughout the day for any questions or workday calls that arise with the team and/or client.
Lunch Break, Deep Work & Crunch Time
Lunch Break

We encourage all Codelitt employees to take a break during the day and enjoy their lunch and work breaks. However, we do ask that you keep these breaks to a reasonable amount of time (maximum 1 hour) so the team is able to reach you via Slack throughout the day if needed.



Deep Work

We encourage you to spend any free time you have doing research, contributing to open source projects, optimizing tasks, code, whatever! This comes with the condition that your main responsibilities are managed and handled first and that you communicate what you will be doing to your direct manager.



Crunch time

Sometimes the teams are required to work late or during a weekend during crunch time for a project. In these cases, the company will pay for your meal providing it‚Äôs approved by the manager first. Meals include pizza, burgers, etc.
Check with your manager before ordering any food.
You will be required to fill in an expense report, detailed in Section 5
Communication Policy
Codelitt uses Zoom, Slack, Trello, GSuite, and Notion to communicate and share documents.

Please review our Slack Etiquette guidelines! üëá
We ask that you be available throughout your working day and respond to all e-mails / Slack messages during this time.
If you are unavailable or away from e-mail and Slack for longer than 1 hour, please update your Slack status (i.e. ‚Äúaway, in a meeting, on a call,‚Äù etc.) for the team‚Äôs reference.
In cases where urgent updates are required, we ask that all team members update their Slack profile with a recommended phone number (or for international calls, a Whatsapp phone number).
 If you are uncomfortable providing this information directly, please let People Ops (PeopleOps@Codelitt.com) know and your number will only be provided to your manager or other team members at your consent.


Slack Etiquette - Top 10 Guidelines
Codelitt is a remote and fully distributed team, so we rely on Slack to communicate and provide project updates. With this in mind, please review the following tips and guidelines to make sure we are communicating as effectively as possible via Slack:

Join our required/recommended Slack channels: Each team, project, and department have channels to keep task updates organized and easy to reference. Please review our People Ops policies (both for contractor and employee) and join the channels listed to get started.
Organize conversations by channels: Please try to keep conversations and topics relevant to the channel. If conversations start in #general but transition to shows and games, please move all your follow up conversations to #shows_and_games.
Limit private conversations! : While direct messages are great for more private details, we encourage all team members to discuss project and team information in our respective channels. This prevents redundant messages and any details that slip through the cracks because it keeps it visible to everyone (and helps us find the information that much faster).
Turn on your notifications: Make sure your notifications are turned on or check your direct messages/mentions throughout the day so you‚Äôre able to catch any important updates, messages, or questions!
This may be department-specific, so please check with your manager or team first.
To minimize distractions, you can also adjust your settings so that the sound is off, and that you‚Äôre receiving only notifications for direct messages or mentions.
Set your Slack Status:
Make sure you‚Äôre available and update your status! As we‚Äôre a remote team, it‚Äôs important that we keep team members posted when we‚Äôre available and able to respond.
Away / Do Not Disturb: If you will be away for more than 1 hour OR you will be in meetings, working on a tight deadline and unable to reply, please set yourself to ‚ÄúAway‚Äù or ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù for the number of hours you‚Äôll be gone (i.e. 2 hours, 4 hours, etc.) to keep team members updated.
Start a thread: If you would like to start a longer conversation, don‚Äôt overwhelm the channel with multiple messages. Instead, please create a post and start a thread where team members can respond.
Tagging 101: Here are some key ones to remember, especially if you need to look back at messages or files later on!
Individual: You can easily tag any member of the team (i.e. @cody, @vincent, etc.) to get their direct attention
Team: Tag or mention a specific team or using the channel‚Äôs name
Note: Please tag or mention teams or people mindfully. For example, if a team member asks you a question, please tag that individual and only mention team members relevant to the situation OR if they need to complete a task.
Acknowledge messages, posts, and requests
Please make sure to acknowledge when you receive messages, posts, or requests from other team members!
It‚Äôs good practice to tell team members when you‚Äôve read their message and when you‚Äôll be addressing it, even if you don‚Äôt know the answer. Communication and updates are key, especially with a remote team like Codelitt.
If you don‚Äôt have time to respond, please acknowledge the message with either ‚úÖ or thumbs up reaction.
Don‚Äôt ‚ÄúSlack Bomb‚Äù
While no one likes to see giant messages in Slack, it is also important not to ‚ÄúSlack Bomb‚Äù. Slack Bombing happens when you send a bunch of short messages in a row that doesn‚Äôt convey any information or action item.
Try to send only one message that covers the ask! Don‚Äôt send messages like the following (as they are likely going to get a notification for each message:
Hey! (1 sec ago)

You there? (1 sec ago)

Busy? (1 sec ago)

Instead, try the following:

Hey, I‚Äôm looking for this file, and was wondering if you knew where it was? Let‚Äôs chat when you‚Äôre free.



11. Praise Publicly, Criticize Privately

Make sure to publicly share praise in the #praise channel when praise is due! It helps build team morale and also brightens their day :).
If you have constructive criticism or feedback for a specific team member, make sure to keep that private and set up 1-1 messages or calls.


12. When to Communicate In-Person or Over a Video Call

Slack isn‚Äôt ideal for every conversation, but please avoid having any conversation outside of Slack unless absolutely necessary so all team members are aware of project updates.
Please keep in mind:
If a response requires 1 sentence = Slack/EmailIf a response requires 3+ sentences, and it‚Äôs still difficult to communicate = Video Call/Meeting

Note: If a call does happen, please make sure to summarize the notes from the call and post to the appropriate channel so that everyone is kept in the loop.

If you are unsure about your work anniversary date or when your third year of employment is in effect, please check your account on Rippling or contact your manager for additional information.
Please give 4 weeks' notice so we can account for the time you will be out of the office and adjust where work is allocated. We ask that all team members coordinate backups while they are out on PTO.
We do not guarantee any vacation time with less than 4 weeks' advance notice.
Note that managers ultimately have the discretion to approve or deny any requests for time off and requests for specific days or periods of time are not guaranteed. Please make sure to request your time off using Rippling.

Unpaid Time Off
If you need to take unpaid time off for any reason, please let your manager and People Ops know! You can request Unpaid PTO in Rippling under "Unpaid Time Off."

Company Holiday Break
Codelitt is off as an entire company at the end of December and returning after the New Year, every year. No need to enter this time into Rippling. Please enjoy this time with your friends and family! These exact Office closure dates will be on the All Company Calendar.

Sick / Disability Leave (Paid & Unpaid)
Codelitt is committed to making sure that everyone on the team is happy, healthy, and able to jump right into work. Similar to Codelitt‚Äôs paternity leave policy, Codelitt offers paid and unpaid sick/disability leave for employees that need to take time off for any injuries or health-related conditions.



Sick Leave (Paid) + Medical Appointments

Codelitt offers flexible + paid sick leave - if you are not feeling well, please take the day off to recover and enter the time off under "Sick Day" in Rippling!

Please note the following conditions:

If you're requesting time off for a medical appointment (for yourself - not family or pets), please request it under "Sick Leave."
After 2 business days on sick leave, we do ask for a doctor's note for our records. Please update our manager and send the note over to People Ops!
After 1 consecutive week (or 5 consecutive business days), this time off is no longer paid. Please request the time-off under extended sick leave/disability leave (more details below).


Extended Sick / Disability Leave (Unpaid)

Extended sick / disability leave is unpaid, offered on a case by case basis, and applies for the following:

You are ill or injured for more than 1 consecutive business week, or 5 more than consecutive business days.
Please discuss with your manager and People Ops how many days off you will need, along with detailed notes or updates from your doctor.


Please speak with your manager or a member of Codelitt‚Äôs management team if you have specific questions or concerns regarding disability leave.

Medical Appointments
If you have a medical appointment, please add them under "Medical Appointment" in Rippling with a note in the description confirming your appointment.

Note: This does NOT apply to medical appointments for other family members or furry friends (these are considered "Errands" - see below).

Errands
If you need to run errands throughout the day, please enter these hours under "Errands." We consider errands to be longer than 1 hour away from work.

If you need to take 4+ hours away for errands, please note that this is considered PTO.



Jury Duty
In rare cases where jury duty is required, please inform your manager and People Ops as soon as you are assigned.

Please provide 1) proof of jury duty summons, and 2) dates required for jury duty.



Maternity and Paternity Leave
At Codelitt, we are committed to a healthy work-life balance and giving our employees the opportunity to prioritize time with their families.

With team members located around the world, we have a general policy in place for family leave that covers all employees (regardless of country of residence):

Maternity Leave: Codelitt employees can take up to 12 weeks of paid maternity leave.
Paternity Leave: Codelitt employees can take up to 2 weeks of paid paternity leave.
Maternity / Paternity Leave can be requested for circumstances regarding family matters, including childbirth and adoption.

If you have any questions regarding our maternity/paternity leave policy and how it compares to the benefits available in your country of residence, please let your manager and the People Ops team know.

Additional Notes:

General

We ask that you provide a minimum of 12 weeks notice when requesting maternity leave longer than 2 weeks, and a minimum of 4 weeks notice when requesting paternity leave, so we can plan ahead and adjust the team‚Äôs workload accordingly.
For leave that is less than 1 week, we ask that you provide notice of at least 4 weeks.
Maternity Leave

Expecting mothers are required to let their line manager know that they‚Äôre pregnant on week 20 of their pregnancy. The company does not require them to announce their pregnancy publicly if they don‚Äôt wish to do so.
By week 25 of their pregnancy, we ask expecting mothers to confirm a date in which their maternity leave starts AND the date you expect to return.
The suggested time frame for when maternity leave starts is between 36-38 weeks of pregnancy, although we understand that this period of time varies by employee.
By having confirmed start/end dates for maternity leave, we want to make sure expecting mothers and the company are prepared and ready to allocate resources for different projects as needed.
Approximately 1 month before maternity leave ends, we ask the employee to contact the company and confirm if they are returning to work on their original return date or if they need to coordinate a new date so the team can plan accordingly.
Paternity Leave

Ideally, fathers should be removed from main tasks or projects and be assigned to off-sprint tasks approximately 2 weeks before the start of their paternity leave.
Equipment and Computer Stipends


Home Office Stipend

Applies to NEW hires only!
Set up your ideal workspace with your $300 home office stipend! Whether you need a new desk, chair, lamp - you can use this stipend to make your office comfortable.


Notes:

You are eligible to use your home office stipend within your 3-month introductory period.
This is a one-time stipend you can use throughout your time with Codelitt and it does NOT renew.
If you leave Codelitt before your 1 year work anniversary, you must agree to deduct the value of your $300 stipend from your final paycheck.




Equipment & Computer Stipends

We are happy to cover the costs of equipment (i.e. tools or accessories, such as monitors, keyboards, screens, headphones, etc) or a computer if you need it to complete your work.
If you need to purchase a new/refurbished computer, please reach out to your manager so we can help configure and purchase one that works best for you.


Notes

To be eligible for either our computer stipend or equipment stipend, you must have completed your 3-month introductory period, and reviewed/signed our Expanded Equipment Policy below. Please review the Appendix below for more info.
Please note that you must speak with your manager before purchasing the equipment to make sure it qualifies for an equipment stipend.
Any equipment that is purchased will be considered company property and you will be required to return the equipment or purchase it at its current value if you leave the team (i.e. termination or resignation). Always confirm with your manager if it fits your and your team‚Äôs needs.




Education (Learning & Development)
In an effort to help you meet your professional goals, the company can pay for your education through approved educational programs on a case by case basis.



Typically, online courses through Coursera, Udemy, or other resources that relate to your field of work are encouraged.



As with most educational programs and educational resources, this would be study completed in your own time. It's exciting to be able to offer you the opportunity to grow, but also remember that  projects are your priority. If you have finished all you can for the current time, then by all means use your extra time to study or work through exercises, however education is normally an extracurricular activity.



To enroll or enquire about an educational program, please speak with your manager about the opportunities and programs available. Again, please note that educational courses are approved by your manager on a case by case basis.

Salary, Performance Review, & Raises
Salary
When determining each team member‚Äôs salary, Codelitt aims to provide support for a great quality of life and considers various individual factors, including: current skillset, years of experience, cost of living in your country of residence (at the time the offer was made), etc.
If you have any questions regarding your salary or compensation, please feel free to speak with your manager.
Performance Reviews + Raises
1 review per quarter. Set goals with manager (personal and department).
1-1s check ins with direct manager every 2 weeks.
Performance reviews and raises are merit based and focus on a variety of factors, including your growing skill set, contributions to your project and/or department, and overall progression with the company. We use Lattice and our competency frameworks to help you track your growth at Codelitt.
Please note that if an employee chooses to move to a different market or location (i.e. not their original country, region, or city of residence), we will not increase your salary by default. This will be up to the manager‚Äôs discretion as they review your performance for the quarter.
Performance raises are awarded on a quarterly basis. Please note that raises are not guaranteed  and do not accumulate in later reviews (i.e. you do not get double the raise in Q3 if you did not a receive a raise in Q1 and Q2).
If you have any questions or concerns regarding your performance objectives and contributions to your department, please speak with your direct manager or request to speak with members of the management team.
Codelitt Disciplinary Policy
In the event that a member of the Codelitt team has displayed unacceptable behavior, a warning or concern report may be issued. Such behavior includes:

Any harassment of another employee.
Attendance issues.
Lack of communication.
Failure to follow processes.
Dishonesty.
Carelessness with clients.
Failure to meet goals and deadlines that are not blocked by circumstances beyond your control (e.g. scope creep, client delay, team delay, etc.)
Failure to perform the responsibilities that your position requires.
Any other behavior that affects the productivity or success of the company.


Incidents and warnings may vary in degree of significance, resulting in:

Verbal warning for minor incidents.
Written warning for significant incidents.
Concern report for serious incidents.
Termination for incidents that have caused irreparable damage.


If unacceptable behavior is repeated, the following applies:

2 written warnings in a 12 month period = 1 concern report.
2 concern reports in a 12 month period = Termination.
A written warning can be skipped and action can be taken straight to a concern report.


Warnings and concern reports should not usually come as a surprise to the person in question. However, those submitting the report will make sure that:

The issue has been investigated and discussed with the other managers.
They can provide evidence of the unacceptable behavior and the policy, procedure or code of conduct it violates.
The matter is kept private.
The issue is addressed with the person in question directly.
The person in question is allowed to respond and give his/her view on the matter.
Guidance is offered to help avoid similar issues in the future.


The main purpose of this policy is to provide constructive feedback and make the person in question aware of his/her errors. It is the responsibility of the company to:

Explain to the team member those areas in which he/she is expected to improve.
To make suggestions about how to improve.
Allow time for the employee to make improvements.




Concern Reports for Managers, Leadership or C-Suite
In the event that you have a concern about your manager, leadership or C-Suite, People Ops will take your concerns seriously and thoroughly investigate your claim. Please do not hesitate to approach People Ops with your concern!



We ask that you DO NOT share concerns or allegations regarding your manager, leadership or C-Suite anonymously (i.e. our pulse survey) as it does not allow us to pinpoint who wrote the comment (and we won't be able to help as effectively as we'd like).



If you'd like to learn more about our policy and process for investigating your concerns, please check out this link:



üõëConcern Report Process (filed against Managers / C-Suite)
Drug Policy
If the Company has a reasonable belief that an employee has brought an illicit substance onto company property and that substance is interfering in their day-to-day job responsibilities, the Company shall subject that employee to a drug screening as available and under the requirements of Florida law.

Codelitt does not tolerate any form of drug or substance use that negatively impacts your tasks and day-to-day responsibilities. If we have any reason to believe that the use of drugs or illegal substances is affecting your work, Codelitt reserves the right to investigate and take further action in compliance with state, federal, and country law.

Termination
Codelitt reserves the right to terminate employment for any reason, however, most terminations are due to issues stated above and unlikely to be a surprise. If you're concerned that you're not meeting the requirements of employment here, please speak with a manager.



Involuntary termination for cause may occur under the following circumstances:

Performance deficiencies reflecting gross neglect of your duties, or repeated violations of Company rules, provided that you shall have been given written notice of your performance deficiencies and shall have failed to correct such deficiencies within 30 days of receipt of the written notice.
Fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement or acts of similar dishonesty.
Conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude.
Intentional and willful misconduct that may subject the Company to criminal or civil liability.
Breach of any common law or contractual duty of loyalty to the Company, including the diversion or usurpation of corporate opportunities properly belonging to the Company.
Breach of any of the material terms of any agreement between you and Company.


APPENDIX: ADDITIONAL POLICIES

Equipment Policy - Expanded
Please note that equipment purchased by the company is considered company property. Under the following circumstances, the employee agrees to abide by the guidelines listed below.



Stolen or Damaged Equipment
If equipment is stolen or incurs accidental damage (i.e. damage was not intentionally done to the equipment), the employee agrees to pay a $250 USD deductible for a PC or $299 USD deductible for a MacBook. These fees are in place to cover the company‚Äôs cost to replace the equipment, and to prevent potentially fraudulent claims.

Returning Equipment
If employment ends, the employee will agree to return their equipment within one business week of resignation and termination, or keep their equipment by completing one of the options listed below:

Send equipment to one of the Codelitt's main recovery points (Miami, Brasil or UK) via FedEx or DHL. Please coordinate with your manager to arrange shipping and reimbursement for shipping costs (including country-specific taxes and importing fees).
If Codelitt and the employee split financing for the purchase of their equipment, Codelitt will reimburse the percentage of their payment at the current market price.
For example - if the price of the equipment was $2000 USD and Codelitt paid $1500 USD (75% of the total) while the employee paid $500 USD (25% of the total), the company will reimburse the employee 25% of the equipment‚Äôs current market value after they receive the equipment.
Keep the equipment and pay Codelitt the full market value price (pending a full evaluation and estimate of the equipment in question).
For equipment exceeding $1500 USD, employees have the following option:
Employees can choose to keep the equipment and pay for Codelitt's portion of the remaining percentage of the equipment's current market value.
For example - if the price of the equipment is now estimated at $1500 and Codelitt paid for ¬Ω of the cost, the employee agrees to reimburse Codelitt $750 to keep their equipment.
Equipment purchases, returns, and evaluations are determined on a case by case basis. Please contact your manager if you have any additional questions or concerns.


Please note that Codelitt will also retain final severance payment until the employee sends the equipment back (either with a confirmed tracking number or receipt).



If the employee fails to complete one of the options above, the employee agrees to forfeit the total market value of the product from their last paycheck to cover Codelitt‚Äôs expenses.

Extended Vacation Policy (i.e. 1+ week)
This policy is applicable if you're looking to take more than 1+ weeks off for vacation.

The employee needs to provide at least 4 weeks of notice for vacation leave. If the employee knows at the beginning of the year roughly when they would like to take their vacation leave, they should communicate it to their manager as soon as possible and request their time off via Rippling, Codelitt‚Äôs time-off platform.
Managers are encouraged to touch base with their team members and People Ops to keep track of pending vacation time.
3 weeks before their leave kicks in, the employee should:
Have a clear understanding of who will be covering their tasks. This means that they will need to work with their manager to organize this beforehand.
If the employee is a client-facing employee, they should schedule a short meeting (or email conversation) between themselves, their project manager, the client and the person/s who will be taking over their tasks to let the client know who will be the point of contact during their time off.
Provide small, introductory tasks to the project to the person/s who will be taking over their tasks. This 3 week introductory period helps the employee going on holiday feel like their work will be properly handled, and for the remaining employee/s taking over their tasks it‚Äôs enough time to raise questions, understand the project, meet with the client and create a relationship with the new team they will be working with.
The week before the employee goes on holiday they should try to wrap up as many tasks as possible. They should understand that while they are away, the employee/s covering their tasks will also still be responsible for their own so they might not be able to cover very big tasks. This should have been planned, organized and agreed upon with the project manager and client beforehand. This is important because our contracts are ongoing, as is our sprint planning. With enough time, preparation, and notice we can plan for the weeks during the employee‚Äôs absence and prioritize tasks that aren‚Äôt as major or ones that will block a project (for both current projects as well as extra work).
Due to the fact that employees will be taking over extra tasks during their team member‚Äôs absence, it‚Äôs important that the company rotates this by promoting a healthy lifestyle in terms of taking time off.
Please note that time off does not carry over and will not be paid out if the employee leaves the company. Employees must take their time off or forfeit it before the end of the valid period (i.e. before the anniversary of their hire date)


Disclaimer: In the event that an employee requests time off outside of these guidelines (i.e. less than 4 weeks notice), the managers have the discretion to approve or deny the request on a case by case basis. The employee agrees to contact their manager as soon as possible if their request meets this exception.

Interoffice Dating Policy
Company employees may date and develop friendships and relationships with other employees, both inside and outside of the workplace‚Äîas long as the relationships don't have a negative impact on their work or the work of others.



Any relationship that interferes with our culture, collaborative teamwork or productivity of employees will be addressed by manager and People Ops, and subject to our disciplinary policy.



All Employees
To prevent potential issues or conflicts on our team, we do not support, encourage or allow employees to 1) date their project lead or mentor, or 2) date their direct managers (and vice versa). This includes an employee who reports to their manager‚Äôs counterpart in another department.



Additionally, any relationship with another employee or manager that may lead to favoritism, misuse of authority or impacts your terms and conditions of employment (i.e. raises, promotions, and career advancement) are prohibited.



Relationships prohibited by this policy include, but are not limited to dating, romantic involvement, sexual relations and close friendships that can lead to bias and conflicts of interest in a reporting relationship.



Colleagues (i.e. Employee to Employee)


Before dating a colleague

Before you decide to date a colleague (i.e. an employee in another department that is not a manager), please consider any potential complications.

For example, if you‚Äôre working with a colleague on an important project, a relationship between the two of you (or a possible breakup) could affect your work and your interactions with the rest of the team. Please make sure you‚Äôve thought about all parameters and risks before making a decision.



When dating a colleague

Please let your manager and People Ops know once you start dating a colleague so they are aware. Any information shared with management and People Ops will be confidential and will not be discussed with anyone else on the team.

Please keep your personal issues and discussions out of the workplace.
Do not allow your relationship to hinder productivity and collaborations with other team members.
Be productive and focused as always. If you find that your work is affected by dating a colleague, please speak with your manager or People Ops.


After you stop dating a colleague

If your relationship ends, please remain respectful and professional in front of our team. We also ask that you refrain from engaging in interactions or behavior that disrupt the workplace, or badmouth/sabotage their work in any way.

If your former partner behaves this way (or if you are an employee that would like to report inappropriate behavior), please report them to People Ops and we will investigate as soon as possible.



Managers
A manager who dates or becomes romantically involved with an employee creates a serious problem for the company. Dating or extramarital affairs with other employees, even when they are not in a reporting relationship, creates serious risk and consequences for the company.

Notably, a dating relationship can affect the careers of both employees with regard to advancement opportunities, choices of jobs, and assignments. Clearly, these relationships can also result in charges of sexual harassment, years or decades after the fact.

If a manager decides to pursue a close relationship with an employee (who is not their direct report), you must inform your direct manager and People Operations immediately. The company will then decide what, if any, actions are necessary to take in regard to assignments and jobs.



Relationships with Clients
Generally, employees are prohibited from pursuing romantic relationships with our clients due to risk of bias, favoritism, professional/personal work conflicts and other serious consequences to Codelitt‚Äôs working relationship with our clients.

If you or another employee initiates a relationship with a client‚Äôs employee, please inform your manager and People Operations immediately.

Additionally, we expect all employees to respect one another, and learn to celebrate and thrive on our cultural differences and strengths (customs, personalities, communication and work styles, etc.) instead of being blocked by them. All our team members should aspire to be forward-thinking, collaborative, patient, and above all, kind human beings.

Equal Opportunity / Non-Discrimination Policy

If you feel that you are experiencing any form of harassment, we encourage you to inform your manager immediately or People Ops immediately.

Please feel free to report to your manager or People Ops any behavior you feel uncomfortable, and we will look into the matter discreetly and confidentially.



Attendance Policy
If you anticipate being absent from work for any reason, please notify your manager as soon as possible. If you continuously fail to account for your work hours or you are unavailable without excuse, you may be subject to disciplinary action (see ‚ÄúCodelitt‚Äôs Disciplinary Policy‚Äù below).
If you will be gone longer than 1 hour, please inform your manager, update Rippling (our time-off platform) with the times you are unavailable, and inform team members in your respective Slack channels.


Work Hours & Meetings


We are a remote team that favors progress and results over set hours.  These freedoms do come with conditions, as stated below.



Mandatory Meetings and Calls
All internal calls must be attended by video conference (Zoom or Google Hangouts), unless there are any issues with internet connection, streaming, or personal circumstances that make it difficult to be available through video.
Note: This exception should only apply under specific circumstances, as stated above. Please check with People Ops and your manager to make sure this applies to your situation before turning off your video settings.
You must make yourself available for the 10 a.m. EST standup meeting that is held every Friday.
You must make yourself available for any normal workday calls which may regard your position in the team.
You must make yourself available to meet with your manager for periodic one on one meetings. The frequency of these meetings will be decided by you and your manager.
If you will be absent or away from your computer for longer than 1 hour, please let your manager or relevant team members know directly.
Note: Frequent absences or long break periods for more than 1 hour without recording this time on Rippling (you must record under ‚ÄúErrands‚Äù or ‚ÄúAppointments‚Äù) will be subject to manager review and discipline.


Client Calls & Meetings
Client Calls and Messages
If you are a member of a team and working with a client that has traditional business hours (e.g. 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. EST/CST), you must make yourself available throughout the day for any questions or workday calls that arise with the team and/or client.
Lunch Break, Deep Work & Crunch Time
Lunch Break

We encourage all Codelitt employees to take a break during the day and enjoy their lunch and work breaks. However, we do ask that you keep these breaks to a reasonable amount of time (maximum 1 hour) so the team is able to reach you via Slack throughout the day if needed.



Deep Work

We encourage you to spend any free time you have doing research, contributing to open source projects, optimizing tasks, code, whatever! This comes with the condition that your main responsibilities are managed and handled first, and that you communicate what you will be doing to your direct manager.



Crunch time

Sometimes the teams are required to work late or during a weekend during crunch time for a project. In these cases, the company will pay for your meal providing it‚Äôs approved by the manager first. Meals include pizza, burgers, etc.
Check with your manager before ordering any food.
You will be required to fill in an expense report, detailed in Section 5
Communication Policy
Codelitt uses Zoom, Slack, Trello, GSuite, and Notion to communicate and share documents.

Please review our Slack Etiquette guidelines! üëá
We ask that you be available throughout your working day and respond to all e-mails / Slack messages during this time.
If you are unavailable or away from e-mail and Slack for longer than 1 hour, please update your Slack status (i.e. ‚Äúaway, in a meeting, on a call,‚Äù etc.) for the team‚Äôs reference.
In cases where urgent updates are required, we ask that all team members update their Slack profile with a recommended phone number (or for international calls, a Whatsapp phone number).
 If you are uncomfortable providing this information directly, please let People Ops know and your number will only be provided to your manager or other team members at your consent.


Slack Etiquette - Top 10 Guidelines
Codelitt is a remote and fully distributed team, so we rely on Slack to communicate and provide project updates. With this in mind, please review the following tips and guidelines to make sure we are communicating as effectively as possible via Slack:

Join our required / recommended Slack channels: Each team, project, and department have channels to keep task updates organized and easy to reference. Please review our People Ops policies (both for contractor and employee) and join the channels listed to get started.
Organize conversations by channels: Please try to keep conversations and topics relevant to the channel. If conversations start in #general but transition to shows and games, please move all your follow up conversations to #shows_and_games.
Limit private conversations! : While direct messages are great for more private details, we encourage all team members to discuss project and team information in our respective channels. This prevents redundant messages and any details that slip through the cracks because it keeps it visible to everyone (and helps us find the information that much faster).
Turn on your notifications: Make sure your notifications are turned on or check your direct messages/mentions throughout the day so you‚Äôre able to catch any important updates, messages or questions!
This may be department-specific, so please check with your manager or team first.
To minimize distractions, you can also adjust your settings so that the sound is off, and that you‚Äôre receiving only notifications for direct messages or mentions.
Set your Slack Status:
Make sure you‚Äôre available and update your status! As we‚Äôre a remote team, it‚Äôs important that we keep team members posted when we‚Äôre available and able to respond.
Away / Do Not Disturb: If you will be away for more than 1 hour OR you will be in meetings, working on a tight deadline and unable to reply, please set yourself to ‚ÄúAway‚Äù or ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù for the number of hours you‚Äôll be gone (i.e. 2 hours, 4 hours, etc.) to keep team members updated.
Start a thread: If you would like to start a longer conversation, don‚Äôt overwhelm the channel with multiple messages. Instead, please create a post and start a thread where team members can respond.
Tagging 101: Here are some key ones to remember, especially if you need to look back at messages or files later on!
Individual: You can easily tag any member of the team (i.e. @cody, @vincent, etc.) to get their direct attention
Team: Tag or mention a specific team or using the channel‚Äôs name
Note: Please tag or mention teams or people mindfully. For example, if a team member asks you a question, please tag that individual and only mention team members relevant to the situation OR if they need to complete a task.
Acknowledge messages, posts, and requests
Please make sure to acknowledge when you receive messages, posts or requests from other team members!
It‚Äôs good practice to tell team members when you‚Äôve read their message and when you‚Äôll be addressing it, even if you don‚Äôt know the answer. Communication and updates are key, especially with a remote team like Codelitt.
If you don‚Äôt have time to respond, please acknowledge the message with either ‚úÖ or thumbs up reaction.
Don‚Äôt ‚ÄúSlack Bomb‚Äù
While no one likes to see giant messages in Slack, it is also important not to ‚ÄúSlack Bomb‚Äù. Slack Bombing happens when you send a bunch of short messages in a row that doesn‚Äôt convey any information or action item.
Try to send only one message that covers the ask! Don‚Äôt send messages like the following (as they are likely going to get a notification for each message:
Hey! (1 sec ago)

You there? (1 sec ago)

Busy? (1 sec ago)

Instead, try the following:

Hey, I‚Äôm looking for this file, and was wondering if you knew where it was? Let‚Äôs chat when you‚Äôre free.



11. Praise Publicly, Criticize Privately

Make sure to publicly share praise in the #praise channel when praise is due! It helps build team morale and also brightens their day :).
If you have constructive criticism or feedback for a specific team member, make sure to keep that private and set up 1-1 messages or calls.


12. When to Communicate In-Person or Over a Video Call

Slack isn‚Äôt ideal for every conversation, but please avoid having any conversation outside of Slack unless absolutely necessary so all team members are aware of project updates.
Please keep in mind:
If a response requires 1 sentence = Slack/EmailIf a response requires 3+ sentences, and it‚Äôs still difficult to communicate = Video Call/Meeting

Note: If a call does happen, please make sure to summarize the notes from the call and post to the appropriate channel so that everyone is kept in the loop.

Payroll options:

Codelitt‚Äôs main payroll platform for US and international employees is Rippling. Here, you can access and manage your paycheck history, tax documents, review your insurance benefits, and more.
We don‚Äôt need any extra information from you as you‚Äôll enter all your information on their platform.

Bitwage (non US based employees only). Codelitt employees can choose to be paid in Bitcoin via Bitwage. Unfortunately, this is not an option for US-based employees.


If you choose BTC, please reach out to People Ops and complete the following instructions:



Bitcoin disclaimer: Cryptocurrencies are inherently unstable and volatile. While they can decrease fees and offer favorable exchange rates, you could experience a payroll where transactions are taking long to confirm on the blockchain or an exchange goes down. This could mean from the time the company purchases the coins to send to you, the value could vary greatly before you have a chance to sell them for your local currency. Security is also highly important when dealing with cryptocurrencies. Please understand these risks both mentioned and unmentioned.
Company Holidays
Codelitt closes the office and we're off as an entire company for 8 days between the end of December - January 1st, every year (due to holidays and weekends, these exact dates can change annually - Please see Company Calendar you exact dates). No need to enter this time into Rippling! Please enjoy this time with your friends and family!

If unacceptable behavior is repeated, the following applies:

2 written warnings in a 12 month period = 1 concern report.

Explain to the team member those areas in which he/she is expected to improve.
To make suggestions about how to improve.
Allow time for the employee to make improvements.


Concern Reports for Managers, Leadership or C-Suite
In the event that you have a concern about your manager, leadership or C-Suite, People Ops will take your concerns seriously and thoroughly investigate your claim. Please do not hesitate to approach People Ops with your concern!



We ask that you DO NOT share concerns or allegations regarding your manager, leadership or C-Suite anonymously (i.e. our pulse survey) as it does not allow us to pinpoint who wrote the comment (and we won't be able to help as effectively as we'd like).



If you'd like to learn more about our policy and process for investigating your concerns, please check out this link:



üõëConcern Report Process (filed against Managers / C-Suite)
Drug Policy

Codelitt does not tolerate any form of drug or substance use that negatively impacts your tasks and day-to-day responsibilities. If we have any reason to believe that the use of drugs or illegal substances is affecting your work, Codelitt reserves the right to investigate and take further action in compliance with state, federal, and country law.

Termination
Codelitt reserves the right to terminate employment for any reason, however, most terminations are due to issues stated above and unlikely to be a surprise. If you're concerned that you're not meeting the requirements of employment here, please speak with a manager.
